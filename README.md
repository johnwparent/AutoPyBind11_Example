# AutoPyBind11_Example
An example repository demonstrating the usage of AutoPyBind11 driven by CMake to generate PyBind11 binding code

This project incorporates the typical example of PyBind11 usage found [here](https://github.com/pybind/cmake_example) or [here](https://github.com/pybind/python_example) and more sophisticated examples derived from the PyBind11 test suite found [here](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11/tree/master/tests)
